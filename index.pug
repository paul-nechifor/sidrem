      # [Sidrem](.)

      This is a [constructed script][conscript] I designed from doodling in
      classes. I later scanned and converted it to an SVG font using a Python
      script available in the [Sidrem repo][sidrem]. The rule for constructing
      the font it that every letter must be a single continous non-intersecting
      line.

      The text below is editable, so you can **select and change it**.
